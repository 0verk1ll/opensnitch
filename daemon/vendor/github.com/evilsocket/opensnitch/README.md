**Warning: This is still alpha quality software, don't rely on it (yet) for your computer security.**

This branch is the reimplementation in Go of the project which is still work in progress, for the previous Python version, checkout the [python-poc](https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch/tree/python-poc) branch.
